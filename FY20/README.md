# Roadmap 2020

<TODO>: Add overview

We have labeled some tasks as investigations to identify those places where we need additional information before we can estimate the full complexity and scope of a task. These tasks can lead to future work, a decision to defer, or a decision that additional information is required. 

Tasks on this roadmap are living. They may move ahead to future years, be identified as being completed, or be identified as not needed. Our ultimate goal is to engage the user community to identify where we can add value.

Tasks status is identified using the following shorthand:

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| bullet| work not yet started|
| check | work completed|
| :runner: | on-going work |
| :muscle: | stretch goal |

## Themes
Funded development for ASC software has been categorized into three very broad thematic areas: (1) Maintenance and Maintainibility, (2) Value Adding, and (3) Research. In this document, we describe lower level thematic areas that ASC software will focus on. This roadmap is thematically organized because of the amount of synergy between projects. In FY20 (October 1, 2019 - September 30, 2020), we are working in the following thematic areas:

- ISIS modularization
- Continue to improve the build, test, deploy trains
- Grow and support our user community
- Increase the number of supported planetary sensors
- Improve bundle adjustment capabilities and control processes
- Research methods for improverd orthorectification
